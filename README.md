# DownRoll (Work in Progress)
A simple game coded in C and 68k Assembly language for an Atari ST. It will be completed by April 8th, 2022.


# Game Description:
By using the 'a' and 'd' keys, the player navigates a ball that drops between ascending platforms. A score of 99 wins the game, but if the ball touches the top of the screen the game is lost.

# What I Learned so far:
- Building and customizing a raster graphics library
- Bit Maps, Screen Rendering and Double Buffered Graphics
- The architecture of an interactive game, starting with a model and building up to a working system
- Code timing
- Programming music and sound effects on an Atari YM2149 chip
